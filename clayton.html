              <span class="description"><h1><small> I've never killed anyone.</h1></small> <p>You know what the placeholder text said before I typed this?  It said, "This is a terrible idea."  You know why that's fucking retarded?  Because I've never killed anyone.  There was that one time with Bills and the Jeep.  And that time I rolled the Jeep with Becky was a fairly close call - but that's the point - it wouldn't seem so reeeeeal if it wasn't a close call.  I'm getting distracted.

                </p> <h1><small> It's getting deep.</h1></small> <p>What really matters is that deep down in your heart, there's a little piece that wants to get a little wild sometimes.  Maybe set something on fire.  Run from the cops a bit.  What I'm telling you is, it's O.K.  Everyone feels this way.  Mike Bills is the perfect example - you get excited just a little bit... and next thing you know you're going 93mph in a Peterbilt semi with a stolen load of cigarettes somewhere in South Dakota.  Some people need a little helping along.  I'm the guy that's there for you when you need it most.  If you need pushed over the edge - whether it's a little kicker or a rocky cliff with no landing - I'm there to give you that shove.
</p> 
                <h1><small> Now... I've been doing a little shopping.</h1></small> <p> I've got that motherly feeling about the whistler party and just want it to be perfect for you and your little friends - so I made you a short film.  Yep - a little film with just the tip of what's to come - and I just put it in there for a second.  After taking a peek into my mind I think you'll realize we're really pretty similar human beings.  We probably have a lot of the same thoughts, goals, and life principals.</p></span>
