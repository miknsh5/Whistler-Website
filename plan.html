              We're mixing it up a little this year and giving everyone a sleeping space.
              That required us to move literally across the road to the Forest Trail
              townhomes. That's right, we have three duplex style townhomes.
              <br>
              <br>
              If you're into preplanning, search for Forest Trails on Spearhead Drive.
              It's right at the infamous bus stop, and offers ski-in ski-out access by
              a forest trail (see what they did there?) that goes down to the Blackcomb
              village.

              More info will be posted here over the next few weeks but here's perhaps
              a major point: If you're planning on driving on non-standard days (meaning
              not Thur &amp; Sunday) email Ben so he can connect you with other singles
              in your area... no, no that's not it. Email Ben so he can connect you with
              the other people that are coming late/leaving early.

            For the few that are new to this trip, we actually have a wide array of
            skiing levels in this group. Don't think you need to be a pro skier to
            have fun in Whistler. And even if you don't want to ski, there are other
            things. One year people snowshoed. And there's the whole olympic park!
            I bet you can bobsled. Or luge!
            <br>
            <br>
            Anyway, for this skiers, lift tickets are now a criminally high $99 per
            day. For Washington residents, I suggest an Edge Card. Other past methods
            include trying to get someone leaving the slopes to give you their lift
            ticket. It didn't work very well. We just ended up watching Hunt for Red
            October back at the hotel.

              More to come here, but basically you're looking at one night of group
              cooking (probably spaghetti or something, but it'll be up to the chef)
              and one sushi night. The in-house group meal (not the sushi)&nbsp;is covered.

              Why does alcohol get its own category? Becuase it's pricy. More to come
              here, once we get the alcohol captains assigned.

              Why did I make this last? This is fairly important. We'll be having the
              usual theme party fiasco as well as a special party event of Beth's choosing
              (so, dancing). It's Beth's 30th birthday. Try to say no. Try.
