                2006 – Whistler: An Introduction
              </strong>
              <br>
              <br>
              In the early winter months of 2006 a large group of Seattle transplants,
              still exploring their new city, decided to take their first official group
              road trip to the unknown frontier of British Columbia. The waters we tested.
              Coincidentally, that same weekend saw the completion of the 2006 winter
              Olympics in… Italy? Soviet Russia? Somewhere. The important part here is
              that the Whistler village was a giant party in celebration of the official hand-off
              of the Olympics to Whistler for the 2010 games. It was a big deal. Someone
              like… Third Eye Blind was there. Or maybe Fall Out Boy? Whoever the kids
              listened to in 2006.&nbsp;
              <br>
              <br>
              We spent the trip establishing some key best practices for futures years.
              You probably need reservations for a 20+ seating for sushi dinner. Flexibility
              in sleeping arrangements is required. We are expert skiiers.
              <br>
              <br>
              While 2006 isn’t remembered by all, this first foray into Canada set the
              stage for…

                2007 – Whistler: Apologies to the Woodrun
              </strong>
              <br>
              2007 begins a three-year run of what is remembered in the literature as
              the "Whistler Renaissance." We found our groove, as well as the Woodrun.&nbsp;And
              with that, the three-day Whistler weekend as you know it today was born.
              <br>
              <br>
              This weekend included such hits as midnight sledding on the slopes, Jeff
              Ma fighting some guy with a frying pan and Naked Will. We discovered sake-ritas,
              we hottubed and Sarah violated the giant Woodrun bear statue. Jeff also
              made a snow... rocketship.
              <br>
              <br>
              In hindsight, we should count ourselves lucky that this wasn't our last
              legal entrance into Canada.

              <br>
              Historically the least photographed Whistler trip, 2008 focused on repeating
              2007's success (again at the poor, poor Woodrun) with more people. 2008
              Saw a record number of non-skiers and proved that Whistler has entertainment
              to offer all. 2008 was your standard second in a trillogy: Nothing notable,
              but also fundamental to the learning experience. After all, it was followed
              by...

                Whistler 2009: The Bus Stop
              </strong>
              <br>
              Where to begin? 2009 didn't necessarily have anything new going for it.
              And yet, when the time came, we had a trip that is remembered with such
              phrases as "We peaked as human beings," "That bar should have paid us to
              be there" and "We broke everything in the condo."
              <br>
              <br>
              2009 had us singing in a bus stop, marching to the rhythm of Steve's whistle
              through the village, completely taking over a dance floor and then proceeding
              to follow Nash (dressed as Richard Simmons)&nbsp;through a workout routine.
              Joe in leather pants. Mouties threatening us with tasers. 2009 remains
              the gold standard for Whistler trips.

              </strong>
              <br>
              You'd think after 2009 we might be all like "Maybe we shouldn't fly too
              close to the sun" or "What price might we pay for man's hubris?" Whatever.
              Mike Nash got us a CASTLE in Salt Lake City and then everyone just bought
              tickets and went. We are immortal. Rules to not apply to us at this point.
              <br>
              <br>
              We relocated the trip to a literal porn palace outside of Salt Lake City,
              put 30 people in it with room to spare, and had&nbsp;an amazing ski weekend
              at two resorts.
              <br>
              <br>
              In the meantime we had a dance party (Theme: Onesies), flew through the
              air with the greatest of ease (into a room literally full of beanbags),&nbsp;played
              beer pong with Nashes uncle and watched the Oscars.
